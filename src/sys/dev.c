  Function: dev_seek

  For now, it is not possible to seek from the end.
  No proper test is made to check if the offset is seekable, an issues will
  probably be raised during read/write operation. In the futur, adding a seek
  callback may be a solution to prevent from this.

  Parameters:
    offset - Offset
    whence - <seek_whence>
    vnode  - Node to read from.

  Returns:
    On success, the new offset from the beginning of the file.
    On error -1.
