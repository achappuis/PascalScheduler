/*
 * Topic: Signals
 * Signals are convenient objects in PascalScheduler.
 *
 * They can be used for synchronisation, or to implement upper-half/bottom-half
 * interrupt handler.
 *
 * Synchronisation example:
 * In the following code, the two LEDs are blinking at 1Hz.
 * (start code)
 * static void led1_task()
 * {
 *     for(;;) {
 *         P1_OUT ^= 0x1;
 *         sleep(1000);
 *         signal_raise(SIGNALS_TASK | (SIGNALS_TASK + 1));
 *     }
 *
 * }
 *
 * static void led2_task()
 * {
 *     for(;;) {
 *         P1_OUT ^= 0x2;
 *         sleep(500);
 *         signal_wait(SIGNALS_TASK | (SIGNALS_TASK + 1));
 *     }
 * }
 * (end)
 * Without, the synchronisation, the LED nb 2 would blink at 2Hz, but there the
 * second task have to slow down, and will be fired at the same rate than the
 * first task.
